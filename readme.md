# Machine Learning Regression Repository

This repository contains a collection of works related to machine learning regression, showcasing various types of regression techniques. Regression is a supervised learning approach used for predicting continuous numeric values. It's a fundamental component of data science and is widely employed in a wide range of applications. This repository covers multiple regression methods, providing both code examples and explanations to help you understand and apply these techniques effectively.

## Linear Regression

Linear regression is one of the simplest regression techniques. It models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear equation. This is the foundation for many other regression methods.
